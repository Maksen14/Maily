## Password Authentication

For production, we recommend installing bcrypt:
```bash
npm install bcrypt @types/bcrypt
```

Then generate a hashed password:
```javascript
import bcrypt from "bcrypt"
const hash = await bcrypt.hash("yourpassword", 10)
console.log(hash) // ‚Üê copy this into .env
```

Add to `.env.local`:
```
HASHED_PASSWORD=your-bcrypt-hash-here
```
